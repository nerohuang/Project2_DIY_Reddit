I worked with myself and I took like 35 hours to finished it.

The 'a-ha' moment was I finally figure out how to push the new data to the database
and figure the whole database structure. And also know how to avoid hard-code
And use JSON object to load lots of data.

I wish I could improve my programming part. Although I finished the program,
I use lots of stupid ways and make code looks very bloated.
I hope I can writethe code more cleanly and beautifully.

I also want to add some CSS to make UI more beautiful, and add the manage system
at the same time.

I think I need more 5 to 10 hours to finish the imporve.

The overall impression of the experience is very great for me. Because I can
already use firebase skillfully, it will help me a lot at the furture. I think
I will use this knowledge to make some small project at the vacation.

The skill I need to improve still is programming skill.
